# Personal Information Component Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Personal Information component, which provides the initial data collection step in the Trua Collect application.

## Overview

The Personal Information component is the first step in the form flow, collecting essential user information such as full name and email address. It serves as the entry point to the verification process and establishes the user's identity for subsequent steps.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The PersonalInfoStep component has been implemented as a reusable React component with the following key features:

1. **Form Fields**: Input fields for collecting personal information
2. **Validation**: Real-time validation with error messages
3. **Form State Management**: Integration with the application's form context
4. **Accessibility Support**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation
5. **Internationalization**: Full support for multiple languages

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/PersonalInfoStep.tsx`: Main component implementation
- `src/components/PersonalInfoStep.css`: Styling for the component
- `src/components/PersonalInfoStep.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the component
- `src/components/FormStep.tsx`: Updated to include the PersonalInfoStep component
- `src/utils/translations.ts`: Added translations for PersonalInfoStep-related text

### Component API

The PersonalInfoStep component is a standalone component that doesn't accept any props, as it relies on the FormContext for state management:

```typescript
export const PersonalInfoStep: React.FC = () => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

### Key Features

1. **Form Fields**:
   - Full Name (required): Collects the user's complete name
   - Email Address (required): Collects the user's email for communication
   - Additional fields can be added based on requirements

2. **Form Integration**:
   - Integrates with the FormContext for state management
   - Validates input fields in real-time
   - Displays appropriate error messages

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays field-specific error messages
   - Visual indication of error state with red border
   - Form status indicator showing overall validity

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Adapts to different screen sizes
   - Mobile-friendly input fields
   - Consistent styling across devices

### Integration with Form Flow

The PersonalInfoStep component is integrated into the form flow as the initial step:

1. It's rendered by the FormStep component when the current step is 'personal-info'
2. It stores the user's personal information in the form state
3. It's required to be completed before proceeding to subsequent steps

### Styling

The PersonalInfoStep component uses a dedicated CSS file with responsive design considerations:

- **Container**: Centered with maximum width and padding
- **Form Fields**: Full-width inputs with consistent styling
- **Error States**: Red border and error message when validation fails
- **Status Indicator**: Color-coded status based on form validity

### Accessibility Features

The PersonalInfoStep component is designed to be fully accessible with the following features:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - All form fields are reachable via keyboard
   - Logical tab order for form elements

2. **ARIA Attributes**:
   - Appropriate ARIA roles for form elements
   - aria-invalid for indicating validation errors
   - aria-describedby for connecting error messages to inputs

3. **Focus Indicators**:
   - Visible focus states with high-contrast outlines
   - No removal of focus indicators

4. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Proper HTML structure for assistive technologies
   - Proper label associations with form controls

### Internationalization

The PersonalInfoStep component supports internationalization through the TranslationContext:

- Added translation keys for all user-facing text
- Supports all application languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian)

## Testing

The PersonalInfoStep component includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. Rendering with proper elements
2. Input field interaction
3. Form validation
4. Error display
5. Status indication

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the PersonalInfoStep component:

1. **Additional Fields**: Add more personal information fields as needed (phone, address, etc.)
2. **Field Masking**: Add input masking for formatted fields (phone numbers, SSN, etc.)
3. **Auto-completion**: Implement address auto-completion for faster data entry
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Show additional fields only when needed based on user input
5. **Data Persistence**: Add local storage support for saving draft information

## Conclusion

The PersonalInfoStep component provides a robust and user-friendly way for users to enter their personal information as the first step in the form submission process. It enhances the application's functionality by providing a clear entry point to the verification workflow with proper validation and feedback.
