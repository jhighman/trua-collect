# Residence History Component Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Residence History component, which provides functionality for users to add, edit, and manage their residence history in the Trua Collect application.

## Overview

The Residence History component allows users to document their residence history as part of the background check process. It provides a comprehensive interface for adding multiple residence entries with detailed information including address, city, state/province, postal code, country, and dates of residence. The component also integrates with the Timeline component to visualize the coverage of the residence history.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The Residence History implementation consists of two main components:

1. **ResidenceHistoryStep**: Container component that manages the list of residence entries and provides the overall UI for the step
2. **ResidenceEntry**: Component for displaying and editing individual residence entries

The implementation follows a pattern similar to other multi-entry components in the application (like Employment History and Education) with the following key features:

1. **Entry Management**: Add, edit, and remove residence entries
2. **Timeline Integration**: Visual representation of residence history coverage
3. **Form Validation**: Validate required fields and date ranges
4. **State Management**: Integration with the application's form context
5. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
6. **Internationalization**: Support for multiple languages
7. **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/ResidenceHistoryStep.tsx`: Main container component
- `src/components/ResidenceEntry.tsx`: Individual residence entry component
- `src/components/ResidenceHistoryStep.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the container component
- `src/components/ResidenceEntry.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the entry component
- `src/utils/translations.ts`: Added translations for residence-related text

### Component API

#### ResidenceEntry Component

```typescript
interface ResidenceEntryData {
  address: string;
  city: string;
  state_province: string;
  zip_postal: string;
  country: string;
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string | null;
  is_current: boolean;
  duration_years?: number;
}

interface ResidenceEntryProps {
  entry: ResidenceEntryData;
  index: number;
  onUpdate: (updatedEntry: ResidenceEntryData) => void;
  onRemove: () => void;
}
```

#### ResidenceHistoryStep Component

This component doesn't accept props as it uses the FormContext for state management.

### Key Features

1. **Address Management**:
   - Full address information (street, city, state/province, postal code, country)
   - Validation of required address fields
   - Formatting for display

2. **Date Handling**:
   - Support for current residence (no end date)
   - Automatic calculation of duration in years
   - Proper formatting of dates for display

3. **Timeline Integration**:
   - Visual representation of residence history coverage
   - Calculation of total years covered
   - Identification of gaps in residence history

4. **Entry Management**:
   - Add new residence entries
   - Edit existing entries
   - Remove entries
   - Display a list of all added entries

5. **Form Validation**:
   - Required field validation
   - Date validation (start date before end date)
   - Visual error indicators
   - Disabled save button when form is invalid

### Integration with Form Flow

The Residence History component is integrated into the form flow as follows:

1. It's rendered by the FormStep component when the current step is 'residence-history'
2. It stores residence entries in the form state under the 'residence-history.entries' key
3. It calculates and stores the total years covered in the form state
4. It validates that the required years of history are covered
5. It allows navigation to the next step when valid

### Styling

The component uses CSS for styling with responsive design considerations:

- **List View**:
  - Card-based layout for each residence entry
  - Clean display of address information
  - Action buttons for edit and remove

- **Entry Form**:
  - Clean form layout with labeled fields
  - Visual error states
  - Consistent button styling

- **Timeline Integration**:
  - Visual representation of residence history coverage
  - Progress indicator showing years covered vs. required years
  - Clickable timeline entries for easy editing

### Accessibility Features

The Residence History component includes the following accessibility features:

1. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Semantic form elements
   - Logical tab order

2. **ARIA Attributes**:
   - Descriptive labels for all form fields
   - Required field indicators
   - Error message association with form fields
   - Appropriate roles for interactive elements

3. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Logical tab order through the form
   - Button actions accessible via keyboard

4. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - Descriptive text for screen readers
   - Appropriate ARIA live regions for dynamic content
   - Hidden text for context where needed

### Internationalization

The component supports internationalization through the TranslationContext:

- All user-facing text uses translation keys
- Supports all application languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian)
- Date formatting respects locale settings
- Placeholder text is translated

Translation keys are organized under the "residence" namespace in the translations file, with entries for all form labels, buttons, and messages.

## Testing

The Residence History implementation includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. **Rendering**:
   - Component rendering with and without data
   - Proper display of residence entries
   - Form field rendering

2. **Interactions**:
   - Adding new entries
   - Editing existing entries
   - Removing entries
   - Form submission

3. **Validation**:
   - Required field validation
   - Date validation
   - Form state integration

4. **Special Cases**:
   - Current residence handling
   - Timeline integration
   - Error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Residence History component:

1. **Address Verification**: Integration with address verification services
2. **Autocomplete**: Address autocomplete using mapping services
3. **Map Integration**: Visual representation of residences on a map
4. **Document Upload**: Allow users to upload proof of residence
5. **Landlord Information**: Optional fields for landlord contact information
6. **Roommate Information**: Optional fields for roommate information
7. **Advanced Validation**: More sophisticated validation rules for residence history, such as detecting overlapping periods or suspicious patterns
8. **International Address Formats**: Support for different address formats based on country

## Conclusion

The Residence History component provides a comprehensive solution for capturing and managing residence history information as part of the background check process. It follows the application's design patterns and integrates seamlessly with the overall form flow while providing a user-friendly interface for managing multiple residence entries.
