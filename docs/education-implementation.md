# Education Component Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Education component, which provides education history collection functionality in the Trua Collect application.

## Overview

The Education component allows users to provide their educational background as part of the verification process. It enables users to add, edit, and remove education entries, with each entry containing details about the institution, degree, dates, and other relevant information.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The Education component has been implemented as a set of React components with the following key features:

1. **EducationStep**: Main container component that manages the list of education entries
2. **EducationEntry**: Form component for adding and editing individual education entries
3. **Dynamic Entry Management**: Allows users to add, edit, and remove education entries
4. **Validation**: Ensures all required education information is provided
5. **Accessibility Support**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes
6. **Internationalization**: Full support for multiple languages

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/EducationStep.css`: Styling for the main component
- `src/components/EducationStep.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the main component
- `src/components/EducationEntry.tsx`: Component for individual education entries

### Component API

#### EducationStep Component

The EducationStep component is a standalone component that doesn't accept any props, as it relies on the FormContext for state management:

```typescript
export const EducationStep: React.FC = () => {
  // Component implementation
};
```

#### EducationEntry Component

The EducationEntry component accepts the following props:

```typescript
interface EducationEntryProps {
  entry: EducationEntryData;
  onSave: (entry: EducationEntryData) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
  errors?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

Where `EducationEntryData` is defined as:

```typescript
export interface EducationEntryData {
  id: string;
  institution: string;
  degree: string;
  fieldOfStudy: string;
  startDate: string;
  endDate: string;
  isCurrent: boolean;
  description: string;
  location: string;
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Education Entry Management**:
   - Add new education entries
   - Edit existing education entries
   - Remove education entries
   - View a list of all education entries

2. **Form Fields**:
   - Institution Name (required)
   - Degree (required)
   - Field of Study
   - Location
   - Start Date (required)
   - End Date (required unless current)
   - "Currently studying" checkbox
   - Description

3. **Form Integration**:
   - Integrates with the FormContext for state management
   - Validates that all required fields are provided
   - Shows appropriate error messages for missing or invalid fields

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays field-specific error messages
   - Visual indication of error state with red border
   - Form status indicator showing overall validity

5. **Responsive Design**:
   - Adapts to different screen sizes
   - Mobile-friendly form layout
   - Consistent styling across devices

### Integration with Form Flow

The EducationStep component is integrated into the form flow as follows:

1. It's rendered by the FormStep component when the current step is 'education'
2. It stores the user's education entries in the form state
3. It's conditionally included in the form flow based on the requirements configuration

### Styling

The EducationStep component uses dedicated CSS files with responsive design considerations:

- **Entry List**: Clean, card-based layout for existing entries
- **Entry Form**: User-friendly form with clear labels and inputs
- **Error States**: Red border and error message when validation fails
- **Status Indicator**: Color-coded status based on form validity

### Accessibility Features

The Education component is designed to be fully accessible with the following features:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard
   - Logical tab order for form elements

2. **ARIA Attributes**:
   - Appropriate ARIA roles for form elements
   - aria-invalid for indicating validation errors
   - aria-describedby for connecting error messages to inputs

3. **Focus Indicators**:
   - Visible focus states with high-contrast outlines
   - No removal of focus indicators

4. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Proper HTML structure for assistive technologies
   - Proper label associations with form controls

### Internationalization

The Education component supports internationalization through the TranslationContext:

- Added translation keys for all user-facing text
- Supports all application languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian)
- Includes translations for form labels, buttons, error messages, and descriptions

## Testing

The Education component includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. Rendering with proper elements
2. Adding new education entries
3. Editing existing education entries
4. Removing education entries
5. Form validation
6. Error display
7. Status indication

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Education component:

1. **Degree Verification**: Integration with degree verification services
2. **Institution Autocomplete**: Suggest institutions as the user types
3. **Degree Classification**: Add support for degree classifications or grades
4. **Document Upload**: Allow users to upload degree certificates or transcripts
5. **Timeline Integration**: Visualize education entries on the timeline alongside employment

## Conclusion

The Education component provides a robust and user-friendly way for users to provide their educational background as part of the verification process. It enhances the application's functionality by providing a comprehensive education history collection mechanism with proper validation and feedback.
