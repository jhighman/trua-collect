# Professional Licenses Component Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Professional Licenses component, which provides functionality for users to add, edit, and manage their professional licenses and certifications in the Trua Collect application.

## Overview

The Professional Licenses component allows users to document their professional licenses and certifications as part of the background check process. It provides a comprehensive interface for adding multiple licenses with detailed information including license type, number, issuing authority, dates, and status.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The Professional Licenses implementation consists of two main components:

1. **ProfessionalLicensesStep**: Container component that manages the list of license entries and provides the overall UI for the step
2. **ProfessionalLicenseEntry**: Form component for adding or editing individual license entries

The implementation follows a pattern similar to other multi-entry components in the application (like Residence History and Employment History) with the following key features:

1. **Entry Management**: Add, edit, and remove license entries
2. **Form Validation**: Validate required fields and data formats
3. **State Management**: Integration with the application's form context
4. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
5. **Internationalization**: Full support for multiple languages
6. **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/ProfessionalLicensesStep.tsx`: Main container component
- `src/components/ProfessionalLicensesStep.css`: Styling for the container component
- `src/components/ProfessionalLicenseEntry.tsx`: Individual license entry form component
- `src/components/ProfessionalLicenseEntry.css`: Styling for the entry form
- `src/components/ProfessionalLicensesStep.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the container component
- `src/components/ProfessionalLicenseEntry.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the entry form
- `src/utils/translations.ts`: Added translations for license-related text

### Component API

#### ProfessionalLicenseEntry Component

```typescript
export interface ProfessionalLicenseEntryData {
  id: string;
  licenseType: string;
  licenseNumber: string;
  issuingAuthority: string;
  issueDate: string;
  expirationDate: string;
  isActive: boolean;
  state: string;
  country: string;
  description: string;
}

interface ProfessionalLicenseEntryProps {
  entry: ProfessionalLicenseEntryData;
  onSave: (entry: ProfessionalLicenseEntryData) => void;
  onCancel: () => void;
  errors?: Record<string, string>;
}
```

#### ProfessionalLicensesStep Component

This component doesn't accept props as it uses the FormContext for state management.

### Key Features

1. **License Entry Management**:
   - Add new professional licenses
   - Edit existing license entries
   - Remove licenses
   - Display a list of all added licenses

2. **License Data Capture**:
   - License type and number
   - Issuing authority
   - Issue and expiration dates
   - Active status toggle
   - Geographic information (state/province and country)
   - Optional description field

3. **Active License Handling**:
   - Special handling for active licenses (no expiration date required)
   - Visual indicator for active licenses in the list view

4. **Form Validation**:
   - Required field validation
   - Date format validation
   - Visual error indicators
   - Error messages

5. **Form State Integration**:
   - Stores license entries in the form context
   - Retrieves and displays validation errors from form context
   - Updates form validity status

### Integration with Form Flow

The Professional Licenses component is integrated into the form flow as follows:

1. It's rendered by the FormStep component when the current step is 'professional-licenses'
2. It stores license entries in the form state under the 'professional-licenses.entries' key
3. It displays a validation status based on the form's validation rules
4. It allows navigation to the next step when valid

### Styling

The component uses dedicated CSS files with responsive design considerations:

- **List View**:
  - Card-based layout for each license entry
  - Responsive grid that adjusts to screen size
  - Visual indicators for active licenses
  - Action buttons for edit and remove

- **Entry Form**:
  - Clean form layout with labeled fields
  - Responsive form groups that stack on mobile
  - Visual error states
  - Consistent button styling

- **Responsive Behavior**:
  - Adjusts layout for mobile devices
  - Stacks form fields on smaller screens
  - Full-width buttons on mobile
  - Adjusted padding and margins

### Accessibility Features

The Professional Licenses component includes the following accessibility features:

1. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Semantic form elements
   - Logical tab order

2. **ARIA Attributes**:
   - Descriptive labels for all form fields
   - Error message association with form fields
   - Required field indicators

3. **Keyboard Navigation**:

   - Logical tab order through the form
   - Button actions accessible via keyboard

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Error messages are associated with form fields
   - Visual indicators for errors

### Internationalization

The component supports internationalization through the TranslationContext:

- All user-facing text uses translation keys
- Supports all application languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian)
- Date formatting respects locale settings
- Placeholder text is translated

Translation keys are organized under the "licenses" namespace in the translations file, with entries for all form labels, buttons, and messages.

## Testing

The Professional Licenses implementation includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. **Rendering**:
   - Component rendering with and without data
   - Proper display of license entries
