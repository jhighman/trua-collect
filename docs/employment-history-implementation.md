# Employment History Component Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Employment History component, which provides functionality for users to add, edit, and manage their employment history in the Trua Collect application.

## Overview

The Employment History component allows users to document their employment history as part of the background check process. It provides a comprehensive interface for adding multiple employment entries with detailed information including employment type, company, position, dates, and contact information. The component also integrates with the Timeline component to visualize the coverage of the employment history.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The Employment History implementation consists of two main components:

1. **EmploymentHistoryStep**: Container component that manages the list of employment entries and provides the overall UI for the step
2. **EmploymentEntry**: Component for displaying and editing individual employment entries

The implementation follows a pattern similar to other multi-entry components in the application (like Residence History and Education) with the following key features:

1. **Entry Management**: Add, edit, and remove employment entries
2. **Multiple Entry Types**: Support for different types of entries (Job, Education, Unemployed, Other)
3. **Timeline Integration**: Visual representation of employment history coverage
4. **Form Validation**: Validate required fields based on entry type
5. **State Management**: Integration with the application's form context
6. **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes
7. **Internationalization**: Full support for multiple languages
8. **Accessibility**: ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/EmploymentHistoryStep.tsx`: Main container component
- `src/components/EmploymentEntry.tsx`: Individual employment entry component
- `src/components/EmploymentHistoryStep.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the container component
- `src/components/EmploymentEntry.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the entry component
- `src/utils/translations.ts`: Added translations for employment-related text

### Component API

#### EmploymentEntry Component

```typescript
export interface EmploymentEntryData {
  type: string;
  company: string;
  position: string;
  city: string;
  state_province: string;
  description: string;
  contact_name: string;
  contact_info: string;
  start_date: string;
  end_date: string | null;
  is_current: boolean;
  duration_years?: number;
}

interface EmploymentEntryProps {
  entry: EmploymentEntryData;
  index: number;
  onUpdate: (entry: EmploymentEntryData) => void;
  onRemove: () => void;
}
```

#### EmploymentHistoryStep Component

This component doesn't accept props as it uses the FormContext for state management.

### Key Features

1. **Multiple Entry Types**:
   - Job: For traditional employment entries
   - Education: For periods of education
   - Unemployed: For periods of unemployment
   - Other: For other types of activities

2. **Dynamic Form Fields**:
   - Different fields are required based on entry type
   - Job entries require company, position, and contact information
   - Other entry types have fewer required fields

3. **Timeline Integration**:
   - Visual representation of employment history coverage
   - Calculation of total years covered
   - Identification of gaps in employment history

4. **Entry Management**:
   - Add new employment entries
   - Edit existing entries
   - Remove entries
   - Display a list of all added entries

5. **Date Handling**:
   - Support for current employment (no end date)
   - Automatic calculation of duration in years
   - Proper formatting of dates for display

6. **Form Validation**:
   - Required field validation based on entry type
   - Date validation (start date before end date)
   - Visual error indicators
   - Disabled save button when form is invalid

### Integration with Form Flow

The Employment History component is integrated into the form flow as follows:

1. It's rendered by the FormStep component when the current step is 'employment-history'
2. It stores employment entries in the form state under the 'employment-history.entries' key
3. It calculates and stores the total years covered in the form state
4. It validates that the required years of history are covered
5. It allows navigation to the next step when valid

### Styling

The component uses CSS for styling with responsive design considerations:

- **List View**:
  - Card-based layout for each employment entry
  - Visual distinction between different entry types
  - Action buttons for edit and remove

- **Entry Form**:
  - Clean form layout with labeled fields
  - Conditional fields based on entry type
  - Visual error states
  - Consistent button styling

- **Timeline Integration**:
  - Visual representation of employment history coverage
  - Progress indicator showing years covered vs. required years
  - Clickable timeline entries for easy editing

### Accessibility Features

The Employment History component includes the following accessibility features:

1. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Proper heading hierarchy
   - Semantic form elements
   - Logical tab order

2. **ARIA Attributes**:
   - Descriptive labels for all form fields
   - Required field indicators
   - Error message association with form fields
   - Appropriate roles for interactive elements

3. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
   - Logical tab order through the form
   - Button actions accessible via keyboard

4. **Screen Reader Support**:
   - Descriptive text for screen readers
   - Appropriate ARIA live regions for dynamic content
   - Hidden text for context where needed

### Internationalization

The component supports internationalization through the TranslationContext:

- All user-facing text uses translation keys
- Supports all application languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian)
- Date formatting respects locale settings
- Placeholder text is translated

Translation keys are organized under the "employment" namespace in the translations file, with entries for all form labels, buttons, and messages.

## Testing

The Employment History implementation includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. **Rendering**:
   - Component rendering with and without data
   - Proper display of employment entries
   - Form field rendering

2. **Interactions**:
   - Adding new entries
   - Editing existing entries
   - Removing entries
   - Form submission

3. **Validation**:
   - Required field validation based on entry type
   - Date validation
   - Form state integration

4. **Special Cases**:
   - Current employment handling
   - Different entry types
   - Timeline integration

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Employment History component:

1. **Advanced Validation**: More sophisticated validation rules for employment history, such as detecting overlapping periods or suspicious patterns
2. **Employment Verification**: Integration with employment verification services
3. **Document Upload**: Allow users to upload supporting documents for employment history
4. **Auto-fill**: Integration with professional networks (e.g., LinkedIn) to auto-fill employment history
5. **Rich Text Description**: Enhanced description field with formatting options
6. **Employment Categories**: Categorization of employment by industry or role
7. **Salary Information**: Optional fields for salary information
8. **Reference Management**: Enhanced management of employment references

## Conclusion

The Employment History component provides a comprehensive solution for capturing and managing employment history information as part of the background check process. It follows the application's design patterns and integrates seamlessly with the overall form flow while providing a user-friendly interface for managing multiple employment entries of different types.
