# Signature Component Implementation

This document outlines the implementation of the Signature component, which provides a digital signature capture functionality in the Trua Collect application.

## Overview

The Signature component is a critical part of the form submission process that allows users to provide their legal signature to certify the accuracy of the information they've provided. It provides an interactive canvas where users can draw their signature using mouse, touch, or stylus input.

## Implementation Details

### Component Structure

The Signature component has been implemented as a reusable React component with the following key features:

1. **Interactive Canvas**: Provides a drawing area for capturing signatures
2. **Clear Functionality**: Allows users to clear and redraw their signature
3. **Validation**: Ensures a signature is provided before form submission
4. **Attestation**: Includes a legal attestation statement and confirmation checkbox
5. **Accessibility Support**: Keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes
6. **Internationalization**: Full support for multiple languages

### Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/Signature.tsx`: Main component implementation
- `src/components/Signature.css`: Styling for the Signature component
- `src/components/Signature.test.tsx`: Unit tests for the Signature component
- `src/components/FormStep.tsx`: Updated to include the Signature component
- `src/utils/translations.ts`: Added translations for Signature-related text

### Dependencies

The component uses the following libraries:

1. **react-signature-canvas**: A React wrapper around the signature_pad library
2. **signature_pad**: The underlying JavaScript library that powers the signature functionality

### Component API

The Signature component accepts the following props:

```typescript
interface SignatureProps {
  onSignatureChange?: (dataUrl: string | null) => void;
}
```

### Key Features

1. **Canvas Interaction**:
   - Users can draw their signature using mouse, touch, or stylus
   - The signature is captured as a data URL for submission
   - Clear button allows users to restart if needed

2. **Form Integration**:
   - Integrates with the FormContext for state management
   - Validates that a signature is provided
   - Includes a confirmation checkbox for legal attestation

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Displays error messages when signature is missing
   - Visual indication of error state with red border

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Adapts to different screen sizes
   - Reduced canvas height on mobile devices
   - Full-width clear button on small screens

### Integration with Form Flow

The Signature component is integrated into the form flow as the final step before submission:

1. It's rendered by the FormStep component when the current step is 'signature'
2. It stores the signature data in the form state
3. It's required to be completed before the form can be submitted

### Styling

The Signature component uses a dedicated CSS file with responsive design considerations:

- **Desktop**: Standard layout with 200px height canvas
- **Mobile**: Adjusted layout with 150px height canvas and full-width buttons
- **Error States**: Red border and error message when validation fails

### Accessibility Features

The Signature component is designed to be fully accessible with the following features:

1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - All interactive elements are reachable via keyboard
   - Clear button is fully keyboard accessible

2. **ARIA Attributes**:
   - Appropriate ARIA roles for the canvas
   - Descriptive aria-labels for non-visual description

3. **Focus Indicators**:
   - Visible focus states with high-contrast outlines
   - No removal of focus indicators

4. **Semantic HTML**:
   - Proper HTML structure for assistive technologies
   - Logical tab order

### Internationalization

The Signature component supports internationalization through the TranslationContext:

- Added translation keys for all user-facing text
- Supports all application languages (English, Spanish, French, Italian)

## Testing

The Signature component includes comprehensive unit tests covering:

1. Rendering with proper elements
2. Interaction testing (clear button and checkbox)
3. Form integration
4. Error handling

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Signature component:

1. **Undo Functionality**: Allow users to undo the last stroke
2. **Signature Verification**: Add basic verification of signature validity
3. **Stylus Pressure Support**: Enhanced support for pressure-sensitive devices
4. **Signature Templates**: Provide signature templates or guides
5. **Signature History**: Allow users to select from previously used signatures

## Conclusion

The Signature component provides a robust and user-friendly way for users to provide their legal signature as part of the form submission process. It enhances the application's functionality by providing a secure and accessible way to capture user signatures.
