# Trua Verify User Guide

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for candidates using the Trua Verify system to submit their verification information.

## Overview

Trua Verify is a web-based system that allows you to submit your personal information, employment history, education details, professional licenses, and residence history in a structured format. This information can then be verified by employers, recruiters, or background check services. The system ensures that your information is complete and includes a digital signature to certify its accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the System

1. You will receive an invitation link from the verifier (employer, recruiter, or background checker) via email.

### Understanding the Collection Key

The URL contains a collection key (e.g., `en101110101100`) that determines:
- The language for the interface (e.g., "en" for English)

Trua Verify supports multiple languages:
1. English (default)
2. Spanish (Español)

The language is set based on the collection key in your invitation link, but you can change it:
1. Use the language dropdown in the top-right corner of any page
2. Select your preferred language
3. The page will refresh with all text translated to your selected language

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during the submission process:

- **Incomplete Timeframe**: If you see a message that you haven't accounted for enough time, add more entries to cover the required timeframe.
- **Missing Required Fields**: The system will highlight any required fields you've missed. Complete these fields to proceed.
- **Date Errors**: Ensure that start dates are before end dates for all entries.
- **Timeline Gaps**: The timeline visualization will show gaps in your history. Fill these gaps by adding appropriate entries.
- **Signature Issues**: If you're having trouble with the signature pad, try using a different device or browser.
- **PDF Generation Error**: If you encounter an error after submitting the form (such as "doc.setY is not a function"), this is a known issue with the PDF generation. Please contact support with your tracking ID, and they can provide you with a manually generated PDF.
- **Collection Key Issues**: If you're experiencing unexpected behavior or missing steps, check the collection key in your URL. An invalid collection key (e.g., "en000000000000") may cause certain verification steps to be disabled or improperly configured.
